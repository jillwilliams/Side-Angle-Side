        Please review the following modules prior to starting this one: 
        <ol>
            <li>
                Congruent Triangles
            </li>
            <li>
                Side-Side-Side
            </li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this module, we continue with the concept of congruent triangles, specifically how to prove two triangles are congruent. We will look at the concept called "Side-Angle-Side" and see there is another way to produce congruent triangles besides using "Side-Side-Side".<hr>

        Side-Angle-Side<hr>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are given 2 side lengths and one angle measure of a triangle, there is one and only one triangle that can be created. Therefore, any two triangles that share the same 2 side lengths and the same angle degrees will always be the same size and the same shape, called congruent triangles. Let's look at two examples of Side-Angle-Side.<hr>

        Example 1: Prove the two triangles are congruent using Side-Angle-Side. Show that there are two pairs of congruent sides and one pair of congruent angles:
        <img src="images/pic3.png" alt="ex3" id="pic3" /><hr>
    </p>
    <p>
        Example 2: Prove the two triangles are congruent using Side-Angle-Side. Show that there are two pairs of congruent sides and one pair of congruent angles:
        <img src="images/pic4.png" alt="ex4" id="pic4" /><hr>
